## :monocle_face: Description Of The Model
*"Let's say we are statistical consultants hired by a client to investigate the relationship between the advertisement and sale of a particular product. The advertising dataset consists of the sales of that product in 200 different markets and the advertising budgets for the product for three different media in each of these markets: TV, radio and newspaper.
</br>
</br>
It is not possible for our customers to directly increase their product sales.On the other hand, they can control their advertising spend in each of the three media.Therefore, if we detect a relationship between advertising and sales, we can instruct our client to adjust their advertising budget, thereby indirectly increasing sales.In other words, our goal is to develop an accurate model that can be used to forecast sales based on three media budgets."*
